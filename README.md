Dimensionality Reduction: Implementations of t-SNE, Random Projection, and C-GMVAE
This repository presents implementations and analyses of three prominent dimensionality reduction techniques, each grounded in foundational research papers. The goal is to provide clear, practical examples that facilitate understanding and application of these methods in various data science and machine learning contexts.​

Implemented Techniques
1. Random Projection
Paper: Random Projection in Dimensionality Reduction: Applications to Image and Text Data
Authors: Ella Bingham, Heikki Mannila
Link: KDD 2001
Summary: Demonstrates the effectiveness of random projections in reducing dimensionality while preserving pairwise distances, relying on the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma. Lightweight and computationally efficient.

2. t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
Paper: Visualizing Data using t-SNE
Authors: Laurens van der Maaten, Geoffrey Hinton
Link: JMLR, 2008
Summary: A nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique well-suited for embedding high-dimensional data in 2 or 3 dimensions for visualization. Emphasizes local structure while maintaining global clusters through a heavy-tailed Student-t distribution in the embedding space.

3. C-GMVAE: Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder with Contrastive Learning
Paper: Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder with Contrastive Learning for Multi-Label Classification
Authors: Junwen Bai, Shufeng Kong, Carla Gomes
Link: ICML 2022
Summary: A probabilistic model for multi-label classification using a VAE with a multimodal latent space and contrastive loss to learn label and feature embeddings. Eliminates the need for complex modules like GNNs while achieving high performance with limited data.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.10+
NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn
PyTorch / TensorFlow (for VAE-based models)
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations
